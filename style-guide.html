<p>My name is Biwash Shrestha and this is Anityam. Anityam is a learning blog sphere for data visualization where
  I will be analyzing data about youtube creators of Nepal. Data is collected through youtube api and will be 
  using data visualization libraries like D3.js for creating the visualization contents. The platform should not be 
  treated as a definitive source of information generation as data visualizations are only  point of views with a certain perspective of the creators.
  With that in mind I do intend to learn and curate data while creating some authentic visualization for fun.
  <strong>So enjoy!!!</strong>
